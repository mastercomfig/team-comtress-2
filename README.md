# Welcome to Team Comtress 2!

### What *is* TC2?

Team Comtress 2 is a fork of an older version of Team Fortress 2, with a community development team fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding quality of life features, with the goal of having those changes pulled upstream by Valve to the modern game.

### What is TC2 *not*?

* **TC2 is *not* a "pro mod"**

While much of the work in TC2 will improve the competitive experience, TC2 does not touch gameplay, balance, or competitive rules.

* **TC2 is *not* a vision for the "good old days" of TF2**

TC2 will not feature game design changes, gameplay additions, or almost any form of new content. If you're looking for this kind of content, [Team Fortress 2 Classic](https://tf2classic.com/) is more up your alley.

* **TC2 is *not* the modern game, with new content/updates**

You're looking for [Creators.TF](https://creators.tf/).

* **TC2 is *not* an alternative, more stable game experience**

TC2 is based on the 2017 TF2 source code leak, which contained an in-development version of Jungle Inferno. This build is rife with issues and incomplete features, and ***is not compatible*** with the modern game client.

## How can I help?

1. **Report bugs that exist in live TF2 *or* TC2 through the [issues page](https://github.com/mastercomfig/team-comtress-2/issues).**
	* Bugs that are present in modern TF2 but are not present in TC2 cannot be fixed in this project.
2. **Suggest quality of life improvements (*not balance changes*) through the [issues page](https://github.com/mastercomfig/team-comtress-2/issues).**
	* These changes should not affect gameplay, and should be unanimously desired.
3. **Install TC2 and play the game to test stability, bugfixes, and performance.**
	* As a separate game, you cannot play normal TF2 matchmaking. You can *only* connect to TC2 servers.
	* Information about multiplayer playtests can be found [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/CuPb2zV).

## Basic Installation

New users should follow this approach.

1. Copy your current `Team Fortress 2` installation to a new folder.
2. In your copied TF2 folder, delete the `tf/custom` folder, as well as `tf/cfg/autoexec.cfg`, `tf/cfg/config.cfg`, and any class configs (such as `heavyweapons.cfg` or `spy.cfg`).
	* Do *not* delete the entire `tf/cfg` folder!
3. [Download](https://github.com/mastercomfig/team-comtress-2/releases/latest) `game_clean.zip` from the latest release.
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP to your copied TF2 folder, overwriting existing files.
	* This will create a folder named `tc2` in `tf/custom`, do **not** delete it!
5. On your Steam Library, right click TF2, click properties then open the "Updates" tab and untick the option "Enable Steam Cloud Synchronization for TF2'
6. Double click `start_tf2.bat`. Note that you must have Steam running.
7. Enjoy!
